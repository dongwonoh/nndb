## Scripts for Intersubject correlation and network labelling

These scripts should be used only as an example/guidance if you are interested in doing network/ISC analysis on the NNDb dataset. 
Particularly, the network labelling script does NOT work as it is, because it requires additional files that result from ICA. If you are interested in running this analysis, please make sure to have run ICA first.
Otherwise, please do get in touch with us for more info or guidance.
